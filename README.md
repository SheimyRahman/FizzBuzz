# FizzBuzz
A basic FizzBuzz written in Go.

# Description
This is a basic program called FizzBuzz that prints interger numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Fizzbuzztwo does the same, but print "Fizz" and "Buzz" when the number has 3 and/or 5 in it too. Feel free to make suggestions for improvements, either by creating issues or submiting pull requests.
